# Data Structures and Algorithms playground in JS

## Conventions
- Branch names will be prefixed with: feature, bug, or hotfix. After the prefix add `/` followed by words in lowercase and separate by `-`. Ex: feature/add-cool-dsa.

- Folder names will be in lowercase and separate by `-` if contain more than one word. Ex: merge-sort.

- Files names will be in lowercase and separate by `_` if contain more than one word. Ex: merge_sort.js.
